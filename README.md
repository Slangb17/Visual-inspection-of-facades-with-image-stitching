# **Visual Inspection of facades** 
#### **- with image stitching -**

This repository is made by 20gr460 a fourth semester robotics group at AAU. The repository contains two programs:
- **_camera_calibration_**
- **_facade_image_stitcher_**

Both programs are written in C++ and require the **_opencv_contrib_** library with non-free enabled for **_xfeatures2d_** to function.

The program used to undistort the obtained images can be seen in **_camera_calibration_**.

The other program is used to stitch the undistorted images which is seen in **_facade_image_sitcher_**. In this folder, the program, the images used, and the results obtained are provided. 

The images can be seen in the [image folder](facade_image_stitcher/images). The images are divided in facades and acquisition pattern. The stitched image, named **_result.jpg_**, can be seen in the same folder as the images.

The image stitcher can be seen stitching Facade 2 horizontal by following this link: [https://youtu.be/bfOpiZvzTyA](https://youtu.be/bfOpiZvzTyA)
